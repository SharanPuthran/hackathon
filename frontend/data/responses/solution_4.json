Maintenance agent reported database query errors preventing timeline assessment, which means no safe recovery window can be established. Network agent identified CRITICAL impact (conf: 0.80), and Regulatory flagged non-negotiable slot (conf: 0.80), but these business/operational concerns cannot override safety. Crew Compliance (conf: 0.85) has data but is irrelevant without serviceable aircraft. Guest Experience, Cargo, and Finance provided no recommendations (conf: 0.00), indicating insufficient data for business optimization. Evolution analysis shows 4 agents revised (crew, maintenance, network, regulatory) with no convergence toward viable recovery - all agents strengthened concerns. No binding constraints were satisfied because no recovery option exists. Confidence is moderate (0.65) due to maintenance data gaps, but decision is clear: safety uncertainty mandates cancellation.",

Let me apply regulatory knowledge from the knowledge base:\n\n---\n\n**REGULATORY ASSESSMENT - FLIGHT EY17 AOG SITUATION**\n\n**rec:** VIOLATION: LHR slot critical 11:55Z with ±5min CTOT window; AOG delay >15min forfeits slot requiring re-coordination; curfew risk if delay extends past 22:45Z departure\n\n**conf:** 0.88\n\n**constraints:** LHR Level 3 slot 11:55Z ±5min CTOT; Slot forfeiture if delay >15min; LHR curfew 23:00 local (22:00Z Feb)\n\n**reasoning:**\n* Flight marked SLOT CRITICAL with LHR arrival 11:55Z non-negotiable per remarks field\n* LHR is Level 3 coordinated airport requiring strict slot adherence with ±5min CTOT tolerance\n* AOG event creates delay risk: >15min delay = automatic slot forfeiture, new slot coordination required\n* LHR curfew 23:00 local (approximately 23:00 GMT in February) creates hard constraint - no arrivals permitted after curfew start\n* Critical network priority (285 PAX, 180 connecting) amplifies operational impact but does not override regulatory constraints\n* No active NOTAMs affecting EGLL operations at query time\n* Mitigation required: Immediate slot re-coordination with ACL if AOG extends beyond 15min; monitor curfew buffer (departure must occur before ~22:45Z to ensure pre-curfew arrival)\n\n**BINDING CONSTRAINTS:**\n1. **Slot Coordination**: LHR slot 11:55Z must be protected or re-coordinated within CTOT window\n2. **Curfew Compliance**: Arrival must occur before 23:00 local time (hard regulatory stop)\n3. **Slot Forfeiture Rule**: Delay >15min triggers automatic slot loss per IATA WSG guidelines\n\n**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**\n- Immediate contact with LHR slot coordinator (ACL) to declare AOG situation\n- Calculate revised ETD from AUH and confirm slot protection feasibility\n- If delay exceeds slot tolerance, request emergency slot or next available slot\n- Monitor curfew buffer: if arrival would breach 23:00 local, divert to alternate (EGGW Luton - no curfew, EGSS Stansted, or EGKK Gatwick)\n\n---\n\n**DATA GAPS NOTED:**\n- Curfew database query failed (validation error) - applied regulatory knowledge from KB\n- Slot availability query failed (index error) - applied Level 3 coordination rules from KB\n- Weather forecast not queried (no specific weather concern indicated in AOG event)",

Regulatory analysis strengthens this by confirming the **binding constraint** of slot forfeiture at LHR. Unlike operational preferences, slot loss is a **hard regulatory barrier** - aircraft cannot arrive without valid slot coordination. This elevates the AOG from operational disruption to regulatory compliance crisis requiring immediate ACL/slot coordinator engagement.",
