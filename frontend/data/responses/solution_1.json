Safety agents (crew compliance, maintenance, regulatory) confirmed operational feasibility with confidence 0.80-0.85. Network agent identified high priority due to 51 connecting passengers and EY17 rotation dependency. No conflicts detected between agent recommendations - all support maintaining schedule through aircraft substitution.",
    "reasoning": "Applied arbitration framework: (1) Checked for binding constraints - none identified by any safety agent. (2) Reviewed agent evolution - 4 agents revised/strengthened recommendations, 3 stable, indicating convergence toward aircraft swap consensus. (3) Assessed conflict potential - no safety vs business or safety vs safety conflicts present. (4) Evaluated network criticality - HIGH priority flight with 286 PAX and 51 connections justifies resource allocation for aircraft swap. (5) Confirmed regulatory compliance - all curfew, slot, and operational requirements satisfied. (6) Validated crew availability - sufficient qualified crew available per crew compliance agent. Decision confidence high (0.92) due to agent consensus and absence of constraints.",
