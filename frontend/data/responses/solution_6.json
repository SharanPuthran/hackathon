No conflicts detected - safety agents (Maintenance, Regulatory, Crew Compliance) unanimously agree on inspection requirement, and business agents (Network) acknowledge operational impact without proposing alternatives that violate safety constraints. This is a clear-cut safety scenario with regulatory mandate.",
    "reasoning": "Analyzed all agent recommendations across safety and business domains. Maintenance declared AOG status (c=0.80) requiring bird strike inspection per regulatory requirements. Regulatory agent (c=0.80) confirmed compliance obligations. Crew Compliance (c=0.85) acknowledged impact but no crew-specific violations. Network agent (c=0.80) identified high-priority disruption affecting EY17 rotation but did not propose any actions conflicting with safety requirements. Guest Experience (c=0.80), Cargo (c=0.75), and Finance (c=0.80) provided supporting recommendations aligned with safety mandate. No conflicts exist - all agents align on inspection necessity. Applied Rule P1 (Safety > Business) as baseline principle, though no override was needed since business agents did not challenge safety constraints. Confidence is high (0.88) due to agent convergence and clear regulatory mandate, with strong convergence across all agent assessments.",
