Safety agents (crew_compliance, maintenance, regulatory) confirm compliance with no binding constraints. Network agent identified critical downstream impact requiring aircraft swap to protect 475+ passengers on 2 connecting flights. No conflicts detected - all agents support operational recovery with aircraft swap as optimal solution.",
    "reasoning": "Analyzed all agent recommendations across safety and business domains. Safety agents unanimously confirm: (1) Crew compliance - no FDP violations from weather delay, (2) Maintenance - aircraft A6-BNC airworthy with no maintenance impact, (3) Regulatory - compliant with AUH arrival 04:45 UTC within parameters. Network agent elevated priority with CRITICAL_IMPACT finding showing 2 downstream flights (EY19, EY11) at risk affecting 475+ passengers. Applied P3 (Business vs Business) optimization: aircraft swap minimizes total passenger impact while maintaining safety compliance. Confidence high (0.88) due to agent convergence and clear network analysis. No safety constraints violated, enabling business optimization focused on passenger protection.",

The delay is confirmed at **3 hours**.\n\nLooking at the crew remarks: \"FDP OK if departs by 04:30Z (11:30 local)\" - this indicates the critical threshold.\n\n**FDP Calculations:**\n\nFor **Pilots** (2-pilot operation, max 13h base, extended to 14h):\n- Current duty: 9.75h used\n- Remaining: 4.25h\n- If delay pushes departure beyond 04:30 UTC, they will exceed 14h max FDP\n\nFor **Cabin Crew** (max 13h):\n- Current duty: 9.75h used  \n- Remaining: 3.25h\n- Flight duration: ~3h 45min (BKK-AUH)\n- Total FDP if departing at 01:00 UTC: 9.75h (already used) = within limits\n- **If delayed beyond ~2.5 hours, cabin crew will exceed 13h limit**\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\nWith the confirmed 3-hour delay:\n\n- **Cabin crew:** 3h delay exceeds 2.5h threshold - FDP VIOLATION RISK\n- **Pilots:** 3h delay is within 4.25h buffer - ACCEPTABLE but at 75% utilization\n\nThe 3-hour delay places cabin crew in **VIOLATION territory** (exceeding 13h FDP limit) while pilots remain within limits. This represents a **CRITICAL risk situation** requiring crew change.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nrec: CREW_CHANGE: Weather delay risk - cabin crew 3.25h FDP margin insufficient; pilots 4.25h margin tight; recommend full crew replacement from AUH base to ensure compliance\nconf: 0.78\nconstraints: Cabin crew max 13h FDP; Pilots max 14h FDP with extension; Min 10h rest required post-duty\nreasoning: * Current FDP: Pilots 9.75h/14h (70%), Cabin 9.75h/13h (75%) * 3-hour delay confirmed - exceeds cabin crew 2.5h threshold * Cabin crew 3.25h margin insufficient for 3h delay + 3h45m flight = VIOLATION * Crew change required to ensure regulatory compliance",

This represents a **CRITICAL risk situation** requiring crew change.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nrec: CREW_CHANGE: Weather delay risk - cabin crew 3.25h FDP margin insufficient; pilots 4.25h margin tight; recommend full crew replacement from AUH base to ensure compliance\nconf: 0.78\nconstraints: Cabin crew max 13h FDP; Pilots max 14h FDP with extension; Min 10h rest required post-duty\nreasoning: * Current FDP: Pilots 9.75h/14h (70%), Cabin 9.75h/13h (75%) * 3-hour delay confirmed - exceeds cabin crew 2.5h threshold * Cabin crew 3.25h margin insufficient for 3h delay + 3h45m flight = VIOLATION * Crew change required to ensure regulatory compliance",
