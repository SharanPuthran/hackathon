    "justification": "All agents converged on the same conclusion: landing gear failure is a critical safety issue requiring immediate aircraft grounding (AOG status). Maintenance identified critical system failure, crew compliance confirmed crew availability for reassignment, regulatory confirmed no curfew conflicts for recovery operations, and network acknowledged critical incident severity. No conflicts exist between agents - unanimous agreement that safety requires flight cancellation and aircraft grounding until airworthy.",
    "reasoning": "Applied P1 (Safety > Business) priority rule. Landing gear failure is a critical airworthiness issue that absolutely prohibits flight operations. Maintenance agent correctly classified this as AOG with 0.80 confidence. All safety agents (crew_compliance 0.85, maintenance 0.80, regulatory 0.80) strengthened their positions after Phase 2 review, indicating high confidence in safety assessment. Network agent (0.80) acknowledged critical incident and deferred to safety constraints. No business agents (guest_experience, cargo, finance) provided conflicting recommendations. Evolution analysis shows 4 agents revised and strengthened positions toward consensus, with 3 stable agents showing no objection. This represents strong convergence on safety-first decision. Composite scoring heavily weights safety (40%) which drives recommendation toward cancellation despite business impacts.",
