## Safety Management

### Risk Assessment Matrix

**Severity Levels**:
1. Catastrophic: Loss of aircraft, multiple fatalities
2. Hazardous: Large reduction in safety margins, serious injuries
3. Major: Significant reduction in safety margins, minor injuries
4. Minor: Nuisance, operating limitations
5. Negligible: Little consequence

**Probability Levels**:
A. Frequent: Likely to occur many times
B. Occasional: Likely to occur sometimes
C. Remote: Unlikely but possible
D. Improbable: Very unlikely
E. Extremely Improbable: Almost inconceivable

**Acceptable Risk**:
- Severity 1 + Probability A/B: UNACCEPTABLE
- Severity 2 + Probability A: UNACCEPTABLE
- Severity 3 + Probability C/D/E: ACCEPTABLE with mitigation
- Severity 4-5: Generally ACCEPTABLE

### Safety Priorities (in order)
1. Safety of passengers and crew
2. Regulatory compliance
3. Aircraft integrity
4. Schedule integrity
5. Cost considerations

## Cargo Operations

### Dangerous Goods
- IATA DGR compliance mandatory
- Special handling procedures for Class 9 (lithium batteries)
- Time-critical pharmaceuticals require temperature control
- Live animal transportation has specific requirements

### Weight and Balance
- Maximum Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW) limits
- Center of Gravity (CG) envelope must be maintained
- Last-minute cargo changes require recalculation
- Fuel penalties for off-loading cargo mid-route

## Emergency Response

### Priority Levels

**Level 1 - Full Emergency**:
- Aircraft accident with casualties
- Immediate activation of emergency services
- Notify aviation authority within 1 hour

**Level 2 - Local Standby**:
- Aircraft technical issue with potential danger
- Emergency services on standby
- Prepared for possible escalation

**Level 3 - Full Standby**:
- Minor technical issue or precautionary measure
- Normal emergency services readiness
- Situation monitoring

## Decision-Making Priorities

### The 5 P's of Aviation Decision Making
1. **Passengers**: Welfare, rights, and experience
2. **Plane**: Aircraft safety and airworthiness
3. **People**: Crew welfare and regulatory compliance
4. **Plan**: Network impact and schedule integrity
5. **Profit**: Financial considerations (lowest priority)

### When in Doubt
- Choose the conservative option
- Safety is never compromised for schedule
- Document all decisions with rationale
- Escalate to senior management for borderline cases
- Maintain transparent communication with all stakeholders

## Compliance Tracking

### Mandatory Reporting
- All safety-related incidents within 72 hours
- Technical defects affecting airworthiness immediately
- Crew duty time violations immediately
- Passenger compensation claims within 7 days
- Airport slot coordination changes immediately

### Audit Trail Requirements
- All decisions must be documented
- Rationale for choosing one option over others
- Approval chain for significant decisions
- Time-stamped records for regulatory compliance
- 7-year retention period for all records
