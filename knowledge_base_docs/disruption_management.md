# Disruption Management Best Practices

## Types of Disruptions

### Technical Disruptions
**Minor Technical Issues** (delay < 2 hours):
- MEL-deferrable defects
- Routine maintenance that can be deferred
- Non-critical system degradations
- Decision: Proceed with caution, monitor situation

**Major Technical Issues** (delay > 2 hours):
- Critical system failures requiring parts replacement
- Multiple system degradations
- Airworthiness concerns
- Decision: Consider aircraft swap, passenger rebooking, or cancellation

**Critical Technical Failures**:
- Airworthiness certificate at risk
- Safety-of-flight concerns
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Decision: Cancel flight, arrange alternative aircraft immediately

### Operational Disruptions
**Crew Unavailability**:
- Flight Time Limitation violations
- Crew illness or emergency
- Crew positioning delays
- Decision: Find standby crew, reposition crew from other flights, or delay

**Air Traffic Control (ATC)**:
- Slot restrictions
- Flow control measures
- Airspace closures
- Decision: Accept delay, reroute, or reschedule

**Airport Congestion**:
- Gate availability issues
- Ground handling delays
- Fuel availability constraints
- Decision: Hold at departure, divert, or reschedule

### Environmental Disruptions
**Weather**:
- Thunderstorms, snow, ice, fog
- Wind shear, turbulence
- Volcanic ash, sandstorms
- Decision: Delay until conditions improve, reroute, or cancel

**External Events**:
- Security incidents
- Political unrest
- Natural disasters
- Pandemic restrictions
- Decision: Follow authority directives, prioritize safety, cancel if necessary

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Accept Delay
**When Appropriate**:
- Technical issue can be fixed within 2-3 hours
- Minimal downstream impact
- Weather expected to improve soon
- Crew duty time sufficient with delay buffer

**Considerations**:
- EU261 compensation triggered at 3+ hours
- Passenger connection risks
- Crew duty limitations
- Airport curfew restrictions
- Network knock-on effects

**Cost Range**: €50K - €300K depending on duration and size

### Option 2: Aircraft Swap
**When Appropriate**:
- Original aircraft has major technical issue
- Spare aircraft available at hub or nearby
- Time savings justify repositioning costs
- Critical flights with high downstream impact

**Considerations**:
- Aircraft availability and positioning time
- Fuel, crew, and handling costs for positioning
- Passenger notification and rebooking
- Cargo compatibility (wide-body to narrow-body issues)

**Cost Range**: €150K - €500K including positioning

### Option 3: Passenger Rebooking
**When Appropriate**:
- Delay expected to exceed 4-6 hours
- Alternative flights available (own metal or partners)
- Load factor allows distribution across multiple flights
- Airport has partner airline presence

**Considerations**:
- Interline agreements and partnerships
- Premium cabin vs economy rebooking
- Baggage transfer complications
- Passenger compensation costs
- Customer satisfaction impact

**Cost Range**: €100K - €400K depending on rebooking options

### Option 4: Flight Cancellation
**When Appropriate**:
- Technical issue cannot be resolved in reasonable time
- Safety concerns persist
- Crew duty time exhausted
- Weather conditions not improving
- Force majeure situations

**Considerations**:
- Full EU261 compensation liability
- Hotel accommodation for stranded passengers
- Duty of care (meals, transport, communication)
- Rebooking on next available flights (24-48 hour window)
- Reputation impact and customer loyalty

**Cost Range**: €500K - €2M+ for long-haul wide-body

### Option 5: Hybrid Solutions
**Partial Load**:
- Fly with reduced passenger count if weight/fuel limited
- Offload lowest-tier passengers, rebook them later
- Reduces immediate compensation, maintains schedule

**Split Operation**:
- Operate flight to intermediate point, then continue
- Technical stop for refueling or crew change
- Maintains service while managing constraints

**Cargo Offload**:
- Remove commercial cargo to save weight/fuel
- Prioritize passenger baggage
- Reschedule cargo on next available flight

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Safety
**Questions to Ask**:
- Is the flight safe to operate?
- Are there any airworthiness concerns?
- Are crew within legal duty limits?
- Are weather conditions acceptable?

**Red Lines** (automatic cancellation):
- Any safety-of-flight issue
- Crew duty time exceeded
- Airworthiness certificate compromise
- Regulatory violation

### Step 2: Evaluate Time Impact
**Delay Categories**:
- **< 1 hour**: Minor, usually acceptable
- **1-2 hours**: Moderate, assess connections
- **2-4 hours**: Major, consider alternatives
- **> 4 hours**: Critical, likely cancel or major rebooking

**Timing Considerations**:
- Time of day (morning delays cascade more)
- Day of week (weekend vs weekday)
- Seasonality (peak travel periods)
- Connection windows at destination

### Step 3: Calculate Financial Impact
**Direct Costs**:
- Passenger compensation (EU261 or equivalent)
- Duty of care (meals, hotels, transport)
- Aircraft positioning or swap costs
- Crew overtime or positioning
- Fuel price differences (if rerouting)

**Indirect Costs**:
- Downstream flight delays (network effect)
- Lost revenue from missed connections
- Customer satisfaction and loyalty impact
- Reputation damage (social media, reviews)
- Regulatory fines or penalties

### Step 4: Consider Passenger Impact
**Passenger Categories**:
- **High Value**: First/Business, Etihad Guest Platinum
- **Connections**: Tight connections at risk
- **Special Needs**: Unaccompanied minors, medical cases, families
- **Time-Sensitive**: Business travelers, event attendees

**Prioritization**:
1. Safety and medical needs
2. Premium cabin and elite frequent flyers
3. Families with young children
4. Passengers with tight connections
5. General passengers by booking order

### Step 5: Network and Schedule Impact
**Critical Questions**:
- How many downstream flights are affected?
- What is the total network delay cost?
- Are there critical cargo shipments?
- Will this affect aircraft rotations tomorrow?

**Network Priority**:
- Hub operations (more connections) > point-to-point
- Long-haul > short-haul (higher value, harder to recover)
- Morning flights > evening flights (cascade effect)
- Peak season > off-season

## Communication Protocol

### Internal Communication
1. **Immediate Notification** (within 15 minutes):
   - Operations Control Center
   - Duty Manager
   - Flight crew
   - Ground handling team

2. **Regular Updates** (every 30 minutes):
   - Status updates to all stakeholders
   - Revised ETD/ETA estimates
   - Decision checkpoints

3. **Final Decision** (documented):
   - Selected recovery option with rationale
   - Approval from appropriate authority level
   - Implementation plan with timeline

### External Communication
1. **Passengers**:
   - Immediate notification via SMS/email
   - Regular updates at airport
   - Clear explanation of rights and options
   - Proactive rebooking where possible

2. **Airport Authorities**:
   - Slot coordination
   - Gate requirements
   - Ground handling arrangements
   - Security and customs notifications

3. **Regulatory Bodies**:

## Lessons Learned Database

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Optimism Bias**: Underestimating repair time
   - Solution: Add 30% buffer to technical estimates

2. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing with bad option because already invested
   - Solution: Evaluate each decision point independently

3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Taking too long to decide
   - Solution: Set decision deadlines, use decision trees

4. **Communication Gaps**: Passengers not informed timely
   - Solution: Automated notifications, dedicated comm team

5. **Cascade Failures**: Not anticipating knock-on effects
   - Solution: Network simulation tools, multi-day view

### Success Patterns
1. **Early Decision**: Decide within first 30 minutes
   - Result: More options available, better outcomes

2. **Proactive Rebooking**: Start rebooking before final cancellation
   - Result: Reduced passenger stress, better seat availability
